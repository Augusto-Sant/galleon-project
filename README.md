<p>Hello my name is Jos√© Augusto, I'm a student from Brazil.</p>
<p>This website is themed around voyages around the world with a point-like system to buy them, each voyage is a quiz about the specific culture, 
    and I wanted to do it like that to experiment with creating different forms and models for my learning and also how they would be used in Django.</p>
